# Product Requirements Document: Document Processing and Analysis System

## Overview
The Document Processing and Analysis System is an AI-powered solution designed to extract, process, and analyze information from various document types. The system uses ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval, AWS Bedrock Claude for AI processing, and supports multiple document formats including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and images.

## Problem Statement
Organizations deal with large volumes of documents across different formats, making it difficult to efficiently extract, categorize, and retrieve information. Manual document processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale well. There's a need for an automated system that can process documents, extract key information, and make it searchable.

## Target Users
- Sales teams needing to access historical client documents
- Project managers tracking project documentation
- Legal teams searching through contracts and agreements
- Finance departments analyzing financial documents
- Operations teams managing various business documents

## Key Features

### 1. Document Processing
- Extract text from multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, XLSX, PPTX, images)
- Extract metadata from documents (file name, size, type, etc.)
- OCR capability for text extraction from images
- Chunk text into manageable segments for processing

### 2. Document Storage and Retrieval
- Store document text and metadata in ChromaDB vector database
- Organize documents into collections based on categories
- Support for semantic search across document collections
- Track processed files to avoid duplication

### 3. AI-Powered Analysis
- Use AWS Bedrock Claude for document analysis and question answering
- Extract key entities (products, clients, document creators)
- Categorize documents automatically (SOW, POC, Legal, Finance, etc.)
- Answer natural language queries about document content

### 4. Metadata Management
- Extract and update metadata based on folder structure
- Organize documents by client, year, and project
- Support for custom metadata fields
- Batch processing for metadata updates

### 5. Command-Line Interface
- Process individual files or entire folders
- Query the database with natural language questions
- List and manage document collections
- Update document metadata

## Technical Requirements

### Embedding Model
The system uses sentence-transformers for generating document embeddings stored in ChromaDB. The specific model used is **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** with a dimension of 384, which provides a good balance between performance and embedding quality while being relatively compact.

### Dependencies
- langchain and langgraph for AI agent workflows
- chromadb for vector storage
- boto3 for AWS Bedrock integration
- sentence-transformers for document embeddings
- pytesseract for OCR
- Various document processing libraries (docx2txt, pandas, python-pptx, etc.)

### System Architecture
1. **Document Processing Layer**: Handles extraction of text and metadata from various file formats
2. **Storage Layer**: Manages ChromaDB collections and document storage
3. **AI Processing Layer**: Uses AWS Bedrock Claude for document analysis and query answering
4. **Command-Line Interface**: Provides user access to system functionality

## Performance Requirements
- Support for processing large documents (chunking for efficient processing)
- Batch processing for handling multiple documents
- Efficient vector search for quick information retrieval
- Scalable storage for growing document collections

## Future Enhancements
- Web interface for easier interaction
- Document summarization capabilities
- Automated report generation
- Integration with document management systems
- Support for additional document formats
- Enhanced visualization of document relationships
- Multi-language support

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time spent searching for information
- Improved accuracy in document categorization
- Increased accessibility of document content
- User satisfaction with query responses
- System performance and scalability
